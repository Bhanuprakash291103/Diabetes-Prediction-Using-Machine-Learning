The Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the risk of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. By analyzing a dataset containing factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and family history, this project leverages machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations that contribute to diabetes risk.

Using a Random Forest classifier, the model is trained and evaluated to provide reliable predictions. The project emphasizes data preprocessing, including handling missing values and normalizing data, to ensure model accuracy. Various machine learning techniques, such as data splitting, feature selection, and model tuning, are applied to enhance performance.

The diabetes prediction tool is intended for use as a support system for healthcare professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions and intervene early in high-risk cases. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare, providing a scalable, efficient solution for diabetes risk assessment.
